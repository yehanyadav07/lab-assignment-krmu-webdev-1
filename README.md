This HTML code is for a personal portfolio website for YEHAN, designed to showcase his skills, projects, and contact information. The code is structured semantically using HTML5 elements like <header>, <main>, <section>, and <footer>, ensuring accessibility and clarity. It includes a navigation menu, an "About Me" section with a profile image and skills table, a "Projects" section with links to example HTML projects, and a "Contact Me" form that submits user messages. The code was written using standard HTML elements, emphasizing clean layout and accessibility (e.g., skip link, proper labels, and alt text). Users can open this file in any modern web browser to view Akshat's portfolio or use it as a template for creating their own simple portfolio website by editing the content and links accordingly.
